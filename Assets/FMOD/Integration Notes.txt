Fmod Integration Notes
"Event Name" - purpose of script
----------------------
"Hit sound" - Triggers when player hits zombie
"Broom Swoosh" - Triggers when player attacks
"Ambient Groan" - Start Event when a regular type zombie is alive, stop in any other instance (Allow multiple instances, the event should trigger once for every zombie alive. This also uses distance attenuation which shouldn't be too difficult to code, It just means you have to attach the parameter to the zombie gameobject)
"Killshot" - Triggers when a player kills a zombie with a broom hit
"Normal Growl" - Triggers when regular type zombie gets close, distance is up to you (Will only play sound some of the time)
"Player footsteps" - Start event when player is walking, stop in any other event (Let me know when this one is implemented so I can fine tune the speed)
"Zombie attack" - Trigger when zombie attacks
"LvlMusic1" - Start event when level begins, stop when level ends. Define Parameter for "dead" and "alive". Music will fade out on death
"LvlMusic2" - Same as LvlMusic1
"Dan Talk" - Trigger every time a certain amount of letters are typed while Dan is talking
"Ap Talk" - Trigger every time a certain amount of letters are typed while Apprentice is talking
"PlayerDmg" - Trigger when the player is hit
"Spitter" - Trigger when the spitter zombie attacks
"Menu Music" - Start on enter game, Define paramater for 'In Menu' and 'Entering game', will fade out once parameter is fulfilled
